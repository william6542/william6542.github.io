Hi, I'm William. This website is an attempt to control my own information, but at the same time to share it with my future self, and others who wish to see who I am. 

On this website I will include many things, but the common theme will be that they are created by me. Whether it be book reviews, analyses of geopolitics, hike trip reports, camera or film photos, gear reviews, film reccomendations, music lists, and so on. 

I currently live somewhere along the I-5. 

This website shall be a bridge between the private and the public, a bridge between digital and physical, a bridge between old and new. Perhaps it will provide you with a view not seen before. 

Please note that dates of posting do not reflect actual date of posting. I intentionally edit any given post's date to reflect the most accurate time of when the actual even being described took place, especially if it is an Adventure. In order to further prevent misunderstanding, I will usually include a date time frame within the post text as well. Furthermore, I will also include a posting date, so viewers can see when I posted. This will allow people to understand how long I have had to reflect on the material being post, and the actual happening of the material. I think this dual date system is important for archival and personal reasons. 

All writing and images here are property and copyright of William Wu. Any links to other websites are not overseen by me, unless otherwise noted. 

Special thanks to Moelf for helping me set this up and fixing issues that I would have otherwise never been able to find online how to fix. The path to technological independence is nearly impossible, but Moelf has helped me take my first steps.
