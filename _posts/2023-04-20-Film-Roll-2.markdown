## Film Roll #2
The film roll was shot from around 2022 late September to 2023-01-30.

I spent a day last November, I forget exactly when, walking around TangleTown. The majority of the photos of the houses from this set are from that day's walk. 

To start things off, we have me, sitting on the roof. This was a fun self portrait. I may have sat too far away though.
