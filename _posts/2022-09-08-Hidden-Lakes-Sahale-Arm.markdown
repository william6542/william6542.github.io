## Hidden Lakes
After the trip to Flett Glacier, I realized the smoke was closing in on the season. I had to shift somewhere, so I shifted north. I also knew that once I graduated from UW, I will likely move back to Portland to save on rent money. So I should take advantage of my current location to hike as much the regions north of Seattle as possible. 

I had not yet been to North Cascades, so I thought this would be a fine introduction. (On the way up the dirt road to the trailhead, I saw this guy who was backpacking along the winding road. Why?) I arrived at Hidden Lake trailhead at 10am, which was already late. I snagged the last of 18 spots of parking. It was tight. (But actually, arriving this late also had a hidden benefit.) The trail to the lookout is actually quite short, and generally quite gentle, defined, and not dangerous. The smoke was quite bad down in the valley, and ascending didn't make it any better. 

Going up:

There were a lot of people. In fact, many of them coming down. It appears most people arrived very early, and either reached the top and got turned off by the smoke, so left early, or just backed out halfway due to the smoke. But I knew there was wind due this afternoon, and at least for three days straight, so I was betting on that. I kept going. Eventually, I could see the lookout teetering over what looked like an impossibly tall spire. I had to get up that? But I did. 

Inside the lookout:

As I sat on the mountain side, waiting for the winds to come, I saw a little pyka. It kept looking at me. Menacingly.

Finally the winds cleared to the extent that I could make out El Dorado Peak and Glacier in the back. It was faint, but visible. A little bit dissappointing, and I wondered what it would have looked like without all the smoke. At this point around 4pm, I was the only one up here. The winds, despite blowing hard and trying their best, could not push away the smoke. I was getting cold. I decided I should start going down, since it was clear that the smoke was too heavy today. As I was going down, I met the backpacker who was walking on the road. He said he came all the way from Darrington, because last time he parked along the Cascade Pass Road his car was totally vandalized, burgalrized, and wrecked. He said never again. So he hiked the entire road and up to this lookout. I'm not sure if he was insane, traumatized, or just hardcore. He seemed very sketchy, so I decided to yeet out. In total, I spent from 1pm to 4pm up next to the lookout. 

On the way down, the western glaciers on El Dorado started appearing, and the view was good. I could finally see the far ridges and hills along the valley I came up. It was nice.

Going back into the forest, the air was cleaner, and the trail had some nice walkways and stairs. Not having to walk on the degraded mud trail (due to heavy use) was a creature comfort.

Arriving at the car, I drove a half hour deeper into the Cascades, and arrived at Mineral Park Campground (East Section). There are four spots there, and I was the only one that night, despite each spot being reserved. I wonder if there should be a better way, people deserve to camp here, but at the same time, reservations are important. Perhaps there should be a rule that if a spot isn't taken by 9pm, it is now open to anyone. In any case, the quiet was nice. All to myself, this giant campground. And the pit toilet was the cleanest I have ever been to. It was incredible. Thank you, person who manages Mineral Park! 

Super clean toilet, literally no bugs, and nice fragrent smell:

At night I considered what I should do the next day. The smoke was heavy, and the winds didn't blow it away today. But Sahale arm would be much higher, and much deeper into the mountains, so maybe the smoke was less thick? I didn't know what to do. I fell asleep. The next morning I just knew I had to go. I drove 3.5 hours out here already, and I camped here... So Sahale Arm had to be done! 

## Day 2
I arrived at the famous Sahale Arm Trailhead at 9am. The parking lot was half full. The wind was very strong, even below the pass. Some of the people who arrived with me seemed visibly hesitant to go up. But I had to go up. 

The scale of the valley before the pass is awesome.

Going up the pass is long, the switchbacks take close to two hours, but the grade is safe and gentle. I keep yelling to scare off bears, as there was a report two weeks ago that Bear #380 was killed by Rangers because it kept maurading peoples' food. This meant that people here were not careful about their food. Which meant that a lot of bears were probably mauarding around. I kept yelling, despite nasty looks from this old couple. Screw them. On the other hand, a younger couple who zoomed past me thanked me for clearing the way. Most people simply don't yell. They just don't think an attack will ever happen. They have no sense of bear safety, no understanding of bears. Such lack of knowledge and careless actions make it more dangerous for all hikers and wildlife. People really need to be educated, or they shouldn't be allowed on these fragile lands. The amount of cut switchbacks along the initial climb was also very sad. Many turning sections were eroded out. Some trees looked like they were about to fall.

Cresting Cascade Pass, looking back towards Hidden Lakes Lookout:

The wind at the pass was insane. It had cleared out most of the smoke in the lower valley, but in the upper valley the smoke had not cleared. I was bummed, but I hoped it would clear soon. Looking back at Hidden Lakes Lookout direction, I could see Hidden Lakes Mt and El Dorado Through my 12*45 Zeiss, I could barely make out the lookout and the lake. It was time to keep going up. 

After cresting the second hill, I was at the first viewpoint.

It was incredible. I thought, this would be a great place to just sit for a while. But it was too early, and the trail kept going. So I pressed on. As I neared the arm proper, it got windier and windier, and it got steeper and steeper. Despite exerting very hard to go up the rocky landscape, I still was compelled to put on my second shirt, so windy it was. Many people turned around at this point due to the wind.

The final climb up to the Sahale Plateau was very windy and kind of sketchy. There was a twenty minute section with a semi steep and very long drop on scree/rock, and the steepness kept making the scree loose. At one point, I really thought about quitting, because it was getting super steep and sketchy. But I was so close. Finally, I made it to the plateau.

---unfinished..   remember to talk about the goats and the people who were getting way to close to them. Like 10 goats. Also the solo hiker girl who went up the entire glacier alone and without any equipment at all, and even summited sahale peak. and then camped the night there, she was insane. also note the overflowing toilet. and the mini castle camp sites. The view of course, and horseshoe basin. Then note my feet washing. 

then going down note the bear and meeting Daniel Horowitz, the Jewish guy who left New York to pursue his own life outdoors on the West Coast, how we hiked back down together, and sang lots of Queen and Beatles, lmao.
