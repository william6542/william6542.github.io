# WORK IN PROGRESS

(This is my full first Github dedicated Book Review post! So far, all my other book review links have been copy pasted from my Instagram.)

### Definitions
Tactical Nuclear Weapons, or TNWs, are nuclear weapons which, as defined by various treaties, are those that have a range of less than 500 KM and generally under a certain tonnage. Furthermore, TNWs are also defined by their main use cases: 1. To destroy enemy army units; 2. To destroy enemy army bases; 3. To destroy enemy logistics and transport; 4. To destroy enemy naval assets; 5. To destroy incoming enemy ballistic missiles. As you can see, these use cases are not the destruction of enemy civilians or industry: destruction of people is in the realm of strategic nuclear weapons. 

However, as the book notes at various points, even a tactical weapon may have strategic effects, either militarily, or psychologically. For example, the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, though they were smaller than even the smallest tonnage TNWs today, had undeniable strategic effects on the psyche of the Japanese Empire. However, for the purposes of the book and my review, I will use TNWs as defined in the first paragraph. 


### Historical Context 
The tactical nuclear weapon was developed as a way to save American lives by forcing a quick resolution to the Second World War, and also to create a bomb before the Axis or the Soviets could. Thus, from the very beginning, the bomb was a strategic weapon in the sense that it cemented the United States' position as the paramount power after the Second World War. 

Yet, despite this global superiority in the immediate aftermath of 1945, the United States and its Allies were locally outmatched in Central Europe by the large ground forces of the Soviet Union and its 'allies'. Despite predictions by Allied high command that the Soviets would likely not be able to push the Allies all the way from the dividing line in split Germany all the way to the Channel, the predicted cost in defending West Germany and France was unacceptable. Furthermore, with Britain in debt, France and Germany in shambles, and the Allies reluctant to let Germany rebuild its military lest they turn to their old ways, the question was pressing: how to match the Soviets' conventional military capability? The answer was TNWs. 

Fast forward to the rise of the Wall (1961). At this point, the Soviet conventional military was overwhelming. Furthermore, given the political powderkeg that as West Berlin, it would be impossible to defend NATO territory without the use of TNWs. The dilenma: if the Soviets were to threaten West Berlin, would the Allies back down? Or would they fight? If they fought, there was no way they could hold West Berlin, as it was an island in the midst of East Germany. No amount of conventional forces could provide a credible deterrent: stationing them in West Berlin would simply lead to a blockade and supply choke, trying to rush forces to create a land bridge would be very difficult against overwhelming Russian infantry numbers. But it was also politically impossible to not defend West Berlin either. Thus, while West Berlin held little military or economic value, it's political value was very high. It was the litmus test of resolve for NATO, especially the United States, in the defense of its Allies. Again, the solution to this problem was TNWs. 

Not only were TNWs cheaper to build and maintain than conventional armies, but they were also provided huge firepower. Certainly, both Germanies and Poland did not like the fact that NATO had amassed large numbers of TNWs, as any war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact would result in an "irradiated Germany and Poland". But the TNW was here to stay. I personally believe that the implicit understanding between the USA and USSR during this era, up until the dissolution of the USSR, was that TNWs were 'fair' for NATO to employ en masse simply because they could not hold against the USSR's conventional military (especially after the United States' further involvement in Vietnam, and subsequent military shrinking).

However, everything changed with the rise of Gorbachev, the fall of the USSR, and the expansion of NATO. Now, although Russia's military capacity is still quite powerful, it is in fact unable to pose a major invasive threat to NATO. Thus, the implicit agreement has changed: Russia has stockpiled a large number of TNWs, while American TNWs have decreased to only 100 in Europe. (France and UK have no TNWs). What are some implications of this current path? What are the reasons for certain nations' actions? We will start from this jumping off point.  

### American Perspective
The most important actor, the United States, is the backbone of the free world. Athough it has become popular to accuse the United States of neo-imperialism, oilgarchy, invading helpless states, forcing people to adopt its culture and 'world order', it is still the fact that without the United States' involvement in World War II, China would likely be half-enslaved by Japan, Continental Europe would be completley Soviet, and the UK would still control the majority of their colonies. The backbone of the backbone is provided by the USA's nuclear arsenal. Although American conventional capability is unmatched in the world, it simply cannot keep up with all the various potential adversaries that are popping up in the world. Furthermore, the power of a large number of advanced nuclear weapons is such that they allow the United States to coerce without fighting. 

Thus, despite calls from various factions within the United States to decrease its nuclear arsenal, the military has consistenly and staunchly advocated for the continued maintenance of America's nuclear capability: for they understand that as long as there are nuclear weapons in the world, the United States must be a nuclear power. 

However, despite these facts, the United States is reluctant to use nuclear weapons. This, I think, stems from its ultimate moral character, as compared to say, the Soviet Union. I think the reason why the Soviet Union did not use nuclear weapons was because it did not believe it could win in a nuclear war with NATO, not because it had any respect for human life. 

Thus, a fine line exsists: a large number of advanced nuclear weapons is necessary to deter enemies, but at the same time, the US has been very reluctant to threaten their use, let alone use them. Of course, this is a good thing, but as many peace activists will say in turn: 'if we don't use them why have them'? Of course, it is hard to prove something's utility when it's purpose is that it's exsistence is to deter it's own use. 

However, the peace, or at least, anti-nuclear activists have grown especially vocal in Europe. In various countries, factions have consistently advocated and called for the removal of TNWs from European soil. This movement towards de-nuclearization, coupled with greatly declining military spending on the part of NATO members which are not the USA, has put the alliance in disharmony. The United States consistently spends 4% of its GDP, whereas the combined average spending of all the other members of NATO amount to only 1.5%. This is much lower than the agreed 2% minimum. 

Rightly so, then, the United States strongly wishes to continue to station TNWs in Europe (even if it is only 100 gravity bombs), especially if the lazy and idealistic Europeans are unwilling to spend more money. Or, on the other hand of the spectrum, 'why should we (the United States) continue to defend Europe if Europeans are unwilling to pay the political and economic costs of at the very least sharing the same percentage of burden as we are for their own defense'? Certainly, the Americans are right, but I also think the US' threat to leave Europe to its own devices is not very credible. First off, such a retraction would be very damaging to US prestiege. Secondly, the EU is still a major trading and cultural partner of the US. 

Thus, for the forseeable future, the United States has to still provide the majority of the defense for NATO, while at the same time suffering massive domestic disconnect and lack of investment in its own people. As long as Europe continues to outsource its defense, the United States will continue to destabilize. Although American absolute power has in fact increased over the world since 1991, it's relative power has greatly declined vis a vis increases in the cost of living, increases in the demands of citizens for a good life, increase in the power of China, increases in terrorist activity, and increase of problem states like North Korea, Iran, Syria, and so on. 

Furthermore, with the rising antagonism from Russia and China, the willingness of all sides to slowly disarm and become more transparent has dissappeared since the days of Gorbachev. Thus, TNWs, even if they do not play a major role in the military doctrine of the defense of NATO, still play a major psychological role in demonstrating American commitment to Europe. Indeed, many Eastern European NATO states see it this way. 

The United States also wishes to station TNWs in Europe due to its proximity to the Middle East. If certain actors their should get way out of hand, the United States would be able to threaten nuclear weapons quickly, especially from its airbases in Turkey. 

### European Perspectives
#### Germany
Most prominent of these perspectives is Germany. Especially since the fall of the USSR, the idea has been that TNWs are pointless because 'Russia does not have the capability to invade Europe, nor does it show signs of wanting to,' at least, according to Germany. Germany, I believe, also wants to get rid of TNWs because they remind them of their own past brutalities. Germany believes that it can simply use soft power to create allies, but as the recent decades have shown, economic development and connection do not always result in democratization or the creation of trusting relationships. In fact, a relationship without oversight generally does not develop into a good one. Thus, my theory that a hegemon is required to create stable relationships (since the security and arbitration is outsourced to the hegemon) is proven again. Whereas France and Germany were not able to reconcilate after WW1, they were clearly able to after WW2, with the creation of the EEC under the aegis of the Marshall Plan and the American military/nuclear umbrella. Germany's anti TNW stance is also a result of its anti nuclear power stance. Again, people have fallen prey to thinking of different matters in large blocs unilaterally. This is another demonstration of people's inability to separate things and hold two seemingly opposing stances at the same time. 

Germany also is fundamentally wrong one strategic point: namely that Russia will always be friendly and continue to deliver energy resources. As we are seeing, this has had drastic consequences on the European security situation. 

#### France / Poland / Baltics
Out of all the EU powers, France is polar opposite of Germany. Athough France has no TNWs, it is vehmently opposed to the withdrawl of American TNWs from NATO, and will accept no input from other allies on its own strategic arsenal. France, especially since DeGaulle, has grown wary of Anglo-Saxon perfidy, and while willing to cooperate with the UK and USA, is not willing to be subsumed into their military command structure. Thus, while the United States may be willing to remove TNWs from Europe as a method of appeasing some EU allies or as a way to get Russia to reduce its stockpile, France is the last backstop and will probably never agree to this. Since any agreement to the removal of American TNWs will likely undermine France's position as an independent nuclear power. Furthermore, France, like Poland and the Baltics, sees the US TNW deployment in Europe as a signal of its firm commitment to the alliance. As history has shown, it was these countries, but especially Poland, which took the vast majority of the damage in both World Wars. 

The Baltics are also especially concerned about American commitment, because even if NATO as a whole can hold on against a Russian invasion, a localized Russian attack on the Baltics would be difficult to hold off, given the Baltics' exposed position. (Now it is not so exposed with the coming addition of Sweden and Finland, but it is still vulnerable). 

#### The UK
The United Kingdom is ambivalent. It has no desire to decrease its strategic arsenal, but nor is it showing any signs of modernizing it. Rather, it is continuing to rely on American style SLBMs to load its submarine tubes. The United Kingdom, despite having left the EU, is willing to consider the reduction or removal of TNWs from Europe, if it means increasing the cohesion of NATO as a whole. The UK's threat perception, although more accurate than Germany (it certainly recognizes Russia as a threat), is still not as urgent as that of Poland/Baltics (adversary Russia), or Turkey (adversary certain Middle Eastern actors and terrorist groups, and to a lesser extent Russia).
