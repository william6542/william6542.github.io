Had music. Laughed at <span class="name">Joe</span> and <span class="name">Charlie</span> about going to "Hunt"('s) <span class="name">Charlie</span> has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not been lately seen going up the <span class="place">creek</span>. – We suppose it is because the fish are all "Young."

After <span class="place">school</span> I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, "Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean." A I came across the <span class="place">bridge</span> I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the Modesto paper. <span class="name">Jesse</span> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture</p>

I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <span class="name">Nellie</span> about <span class="place">school</span>. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <span class="name">Jesse</span> went to Modesto. <span class="name">Roy</span> cut wood. <span class="name">Mary</span> baked all morning.

            <p>Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see Mr. <span class="name">Strate</span>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after <span class="place">school</span> is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to <span class="name">mamma</span> and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <span class="name">Jess</span> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>
